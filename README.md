# Javascript Sandbox

I finally got everything working in a robust way. Originally I was trying to use standalone electron but the issue with that was there was limited documentation on how to facilitate the communication between html and js for an application like that. Instead I did more research and found a way to create a local server and use that to use the react components.

# To start the hot reloading electron app:

`npm start`

so much easier than what I was doing.

# To create an exe of this:

`npm run make`

The exe will be in:

`my-app\out\my-app-win32-x64\my-app.exe`

The setup exe will be in:

`my-app\out\make\squirrel.windows\x64\my-app-1.0.0 Setup.exe`
